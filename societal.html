    <p>Members/Citizens:<br><br> In our utopia, anyone is welcome to become a citizen. Our utopia will have about 5 million citizens. Members who wish to become citizens must fill out paperwork and tell us why they would like to be an inhabitant of our utopia. In our utopia, everyone is equal and has equal rights. Everyone has the right to vote, the right to express their opinions, and the freedom of speech.</p>
    <p>Science, Technology & Environment:<br><br> We will use technology in our environment to fulfill the needs of people. Technology will also help us advance in our economy. Technology can help the citizens communicate with others across our vast land. It will help with education and healthcare. Those in hospitals can use the technology to help them cure the patients. Educators can instruct their students using technology. Selling technology can help improve our economy even more. Our scientists will work on finding solutions to different problems that will impact the future. Our energy sources are renewable, and will never run out. We will use solar panels to generate electricity. Solar panels are a great way to prevent any unwanted waste such as pollution, (which is being avoided in our society). We will dispose of our societyâ€™s wastes by reusing them to prevent a big waste pileup. We recycle waste in order to not be wasteful, and use all the resources given to us.</p>
